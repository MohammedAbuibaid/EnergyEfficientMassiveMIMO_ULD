# Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO System: Exploiting User Location Distribution Variation

## Overview
This repository contains the simulation and analysis code used in our research paper, "[Energy-efficient massive MIMO system: Exploiting user location distribution variation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeue.2016.11.013)", by Mohammed A. Abuibaid and Sultan Aldırmaz Çolak, published in the AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications. The paper presents a novel approach to enhance energy efficiency in 5G massive MIMO systems by leveraging user location distribution (ULD) variations.

## Abstract
In the quest for high data rates and energy efficiency in 5G systems, this study introduces a dynamic resource allocation strategy in a load-adaptive massive MIMO system. It evaluates how ULD variations impact energy efficiency, proposing models like boundary focused (BF), middle focused (MF), uniform, and center focused (CF) ULD variations. The research demonstrates significant energy savings by optimally adjusting the number of active antennas based on ULD models and cell loading conditions.

## Key Findings
- Up to one-third of active antennas can be turned off daily, conserving 36–50% of the energy.
- The optimal number of antennas primarily depends on the ULD model and secondarily on cell loading.
- Dynamic ULD models with adaptive antenna systems can significantly outperform fixed antenna systems in terms of energy efficiency.
